# Movie-Recommendation

This project mainly uses three approaches to build a Recommendation model for the movies dataset. 

* Content-Based Filtering
* Collaborative Filtering
  - Memory Based Filtering 
  - Model-Based Filtering
* Hybrid Filtering

## Dataset

In this project, I will be working on the Movies dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). These files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. It contains 5 data files containing information regarding the movie metadata, credits, ratings, keywords and links. This dataset is an ensemble of data collected from GroupLens and TMDB.
